<p dir="ltr">Today was quite productive: I have made significant progress in refining my Tic Tac Toe game in order to make it more robust and increasingly scalable. The first major hurdle jumped in order to make my game scale to a larger size board was...creating a larger sized board. The Board class can now take any size width, square it, and return a complete string representation of the board with line breaks in between each row.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I also solidified my understanding of how to use the rspec method ‘should_receive.’ The standard way of using the method looks like:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Class.should_receive(:method).with(“message”)</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to check to see if a method is being called you can just leave out the .with(“message”) part. I think. There might be some further complications that I am not yet aware of.</p>
