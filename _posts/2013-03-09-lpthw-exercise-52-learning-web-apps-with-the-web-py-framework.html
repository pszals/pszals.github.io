<p>Problem:<br />Could not get nosetests to run, kept getting NameError: global name <br />'START' not defined.<br />Resolution:<br />Turns out in my map_tests.py file I had put "from bin.map import Room" instead of "from bin.map import *". Simple fix.</p>
<p>Problem:<br />Tried to run my session tracking app locally, but kept getting 'socket.error: No socket could be created'<br />Resolution:<br />Needed to close the other web app open in another iTerm tab which was hogging port 80.</p>
