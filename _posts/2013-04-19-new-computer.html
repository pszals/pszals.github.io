<p dir="ltr">I decided that my Macbook from 2007 was no longer cutting it. It had been a long journey, and I learned a lot about hardware repair:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- RAM upgrade</p>
<p dir="ltr">- screen replacement</p>
<p dir="ltr">- fan replacement</p>
<p dir="ltr">- heat sinks and thermal paste</p>
<p dir="ltr">Six years later, I decided to stick with an Apple product -- Macbook Air, used like new through Amazon Warehouse Deals, saving about 25% off the retail price. Essentially it’s an open-box product; the packaging is damaged, but otherwise the product itself looks and functions as if it were brand new.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Migrating all of my files over was a breeze using Time Machine, and I have been able to jump right into some programming work with Tic Tac Toe. My first hiccup occurred when I tried to use Git. Apparently Apple did not choose to include developer tools with the latest OS which meant that there were no command line tools in place when I tried to install Git using Homebrew. After installing Xcode I was able to get everything back up and working like normal. And I learned a bit about <a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> -- it is an awesome package manager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now that my development environment is up and running (smoothly and quickly!) I’m happy as a clam. Some of my latest reading material includes:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://ash.barebones.com/TextWrangler_User_Manual.pdf">TextWrangler User Manual</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">- Looking for (and found) keyboard shortcuts to make flipping through windows faster</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Good reference for learning grep (regular expressions)</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/">Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">- Learning about naming conventions</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Picking up a few tidbits about best practices in Ruby</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Solidifying understanding of Ruby and why it is good</p>
