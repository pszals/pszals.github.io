<p dir="ltr">At my most recent code and coffee session my mentor told me, “Don’t be afraid to write some really bad code.” I had been struggling to figure out how to analyze a tic tac toe board in order to determine if a winning combination is present. I was paralyzed because I could not envision a complete solution. Instead of pursuing an ideal algorithm, I chose to write some code that would determine if there is a winning combination in the top row. Then for the second row. Then for the third. Eventually I had written a small method for each of the eight possible places a winning combination could exist. About halfway through writing all of these functions I started to see the beginnings of how I might be able to generalize the solution and create the elegant function I wanted to write in the first place. Had I not started out by writing some really bad code, I would not have reached the end goal. Yet even that solution is but a step towards the final abstracted and scalable goal. My function that checks for a winner only works for a 3x3 board, but does not work for a 4x4, 5x5, or larger; I will get there eventually. Breaking large problems into their smaller component parts continues to prove to be an invaluable pattern.</p>

<p>Another quote that stuck out to me was, “Don’t be afraid to do something different with your life.” It reminded me of a conversation I had with an investment banker when I was a consulting intern in Germany. We were discussing possible career options and ambitions to go along with them. I had mentioned that it would be cool to take some time off after working and saving for a few years to sail around various parts of the globe. He wasn’t too keen on the idea from a standpoint of career advancement, as “most HR people in big companies don’t like it.” I look to work abroad again one day, and perhaps do some sailing along the way.</p>
