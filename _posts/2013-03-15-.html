<p>Now that I have a halfway decent way of putting X's and O's on the board, I need to come up with a way to determine if three X's or three O's have connected, or if the game is tied.</p>
<p>Knowns:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the possible combinations of three in a row that make a winning board</li>
<li>Board state at any given point in the game</li>
</ul>
<p>Unknown:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:14px;">If a given board state is a winner</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see if we can put together some pseudo-code.</p>
