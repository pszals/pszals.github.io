<p dir="ltr">I started today feeling rather lost. In order for me to meet my deadline tomorrow of having a working playable game in the browser, I needed to:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- figure out how to split the board into rows in my erb view<br />
- show end of game messages (at appropriate times)<br />
- show AI moves in the browser<br />
- allow game to be restarted</p>
<p dir="ltr">To complicate matters, I had told myself that it should be a pretty straightforward (read: easy) process and that I should be able to accomplish all of these tasks in short order. This put me into a state of mind that makes it difficult to ask for help (I’m lost, but this should be easy!), yet help is exactly what I needed. Fortunately my rational side took over and forced me to realize that I was getting absolutely nowhere on my own. Also fortunately for me I am surrounded by people who are not only highly knowledgeable but also highly willing to offer their advice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For each of these issues I had to ask for help. And for each of these issues I received willing, guiding, and generous assistance. I could not have accomplished my goals today without the assistance of others. As <a href="http://8thlight.com/our-team/doug-bradbury">Doug Bradbury</a> recommended in a lightning talk at a recent <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/">8th Light U</a>, five minutes is as long as you should wait before asking for help. Those colleagues wouldn’t have helped me had I not asked.</p>
