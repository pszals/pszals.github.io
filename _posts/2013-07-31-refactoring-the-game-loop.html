<p dir="ltr">Most of today was spent trying to refactor my game loop and cleaning up code in the process. My goal is to get to the point where I can gather the information contained in the cookies set by the Sinatra app (board state, whose turn it is to make a move, whether the opponent is a computer or human) and inject it into the game loop and expect whatever gets returned to indicate whether the UI should:</p>
<p>a) Continue playing<br />
b) Announce winner<br />
c) Announce tie<br />
d) Display error</p>
