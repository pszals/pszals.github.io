<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/josh-cheek">Josh Cheek</a> gave a lightning talk today at <a href="http://university.8thlight.com/">8th Light U</a> about load paths in Ruby, which prompted me to follow up with him afterwards about the trouble I was having yesterday interacting with my pszals_ttt gem. I was attempting to call the gem instead of calling the binary file contained inside the gem. Once the gem is installed all one has to do in order to play the game is enter ‘tictactoe’ into the command line and the bash script starts up the game. So now it truly is easier to get going:</p>
<p dir="ltr">1.) gem install pszals_ttt<br />
2.) tictactoe<br />
3.) play on!</p>
