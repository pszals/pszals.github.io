<p>I wanted to do a little bit of work to my project for Exercise 52, just for the sake of making some progress on a daily basis. I was able to make changes to the app.py file and sort of got the browser to interact with it, but need to make some changes that I'll get to tomorrow.</p>
<p>One problem I keep having is that my file load paths tend not to work the first time. Then when I fix it and it does work, I immediately forget what I did. (i.e. my from foo import bar isn't working correctly.) This time I got rid of the the 'from' and the app is doing a straight 'import map' from its current directory. It's late, so I'm not quite sure why that change made it work, but it does.</p>
