<p dir="ltr">As the deadline for this project nears, I am informed of a couple extra requirements that are needed before delivery. This occurs late in the afternoon on the day before the project is due. In retrospect, the sly manner in which my client whisked himself away after asking me to commit to the additional requirements, he was possibly testing me. Trying to get me to push back and say, “No, those were not part of the original requirements. I can do them, but it will take time.” Unfortunately for me, that’s not what I said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A late evening in the office and an early morning later, I finish what I set out to do, and am ready to demo for my client’s client: the end user. First, the home page:<img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9b2yvADJNc5n2Kk-ULDmk4zAG298Ox7Uz_x5KDZPOytXzhmY-OOxaHl8IPByttSBYN5ISRKWtVi-B4MGgkLBQWJ-WTRSHHkDUcBdMWMQ_E1CM6MS8Y4pufmi9Q" width="624px;" height="329px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Notice the fixed navigation bar at the top, with the current page (Home) differentiated from the other options. The user can click on any of the clients (or the table row in which the client name resides) and check out the tasks for that specific client, or the user can click on the All Tasks tab to get to a page like this:<img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7N07HNs7h8BuzXiRKhwSZYZ_FdSfOZDz0OeesBWtBqPyXlAOw4v6biB6LgZSlmEynsIk-wIleK4S35_afGuCypaSfv_eFLM-TCwryXaaJPOBsDR6TpgCAx2ozA" width="624px;" height="304px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The tasks are grouped by client (sorted alphabetically) and sorted by priority, with completed tasks having the lowest priority. The user can also add a task like so:<img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CcqNpChhddKJ1Kx7GezffZSdXS5wiHc1EDNLUKyOOp42WAXZaBUjLD2DH4ZS5255z2eAyoD7qxXknqH_PBoUVmXlejn0kUNYESnuj5ur-LFqWhS09W3jPlGsGw" width="624px;" height="331px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">After delivering the product, the gratitude from the end user has made it all worth it. I can tell that she is excited to use it, and it is heartening to work on a project that is genuinely appreciated. Because the timeline was so short (about 10 days) I know there will be requests for more features to come, and I look forward to taking them on!</p>
